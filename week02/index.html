    <p><center>WAYS OF SEEING EPISODE 1</center></p>
    <p style="background-color:pink; font: size 20px; color:black;">This episode highlighted the importance of perspective and how it is relayed in photographs. Aspects that could change an image would be zooming in on one portion of the whole picture, changing the meaning. It could be music, which can change the mood. It could also be the spectator themselves and how they perceive the world, as seen with how the children interpret an image since they only know what they live on a daily basis. It was interesting to put into perspective on how images can become distorted even through copies. This was a fact that I knew but did not comprehend as deeply until watching this video. It highlighted why there is significance in prices when it comes to buying the original. Another aspect of the video I found interesting is how perspective itself is never completely known from the artist’s view; however, interpretations add on a new perspective because our minds choose to view images as such. It was how he had mentioned that images stillness and silence completely change it, even if that is how it is viewed. At the same time, it showed me that one can truly never see an image through another lens such as a video because the original way that it was made, as intended, brings upon the proper form of what we see. I also did not realize how much my eyes go towards one area when looking at any art form visually. It tends to go towards the detail that I want to see.</p>

    <p style="background-color:lightblue; font: size 20px; color:black;">This episode speaks upon how women are portrayed in art and how the reflection is based upon the satisfaction of men. This is true to this day and it is interesting to see that this has been an issue for a long time now. Even as women today, we are constantly stared at and social media today depicts unrealistic ideals of how women should look. This video only solidified that for so long, women have been curated to please others in all physical forms. The women depicted in the paintings that were shown were them nude with bodies that were shaped to be more conventionally attractive. It also is interesting to see that these paintings now in the year of 2022 are history and in a way it is saddening to see that they are false depictions of women. These oil paintings were how the painters saw beauty and that comes in a form of desire, not reality. As mentioned in the video, nudity is being perceived, being naked is comfort; yet, it feels as if women were deprived of that comfort for the sake of appealing towards the men’s sexuality. It is also shocking to see that the women were painted to have less hair since hair is powerful to have. The need to satisfy the male’s needs were also seen in the stance where women had to be perceived as available in these oil paintings, which one could see today with the emergence of thirst traps on social media. </p>

    <p style="background-color:lightseagreen; font: size 20px; color:black;">This episode puts into perspective the price put onto oil paintings. As someone who never really had interest in paintings, these videos taught me a lot about the industry and how truly people emphasize art, making me appreciate it a lot more. I think one of the parts that stood out to me on this video is how people in real life know people are richer through their jewelry, but in the paintings these are even more exaggerated. This exaggeration is surely a way for the painting to be seen as more “valuable,” which is seen in humans too. The more you seem valuable, the more people find you to be. However, this episode truly highlights how paintings are depictions of the real world and the artists’ life when it was produced. It is also a beautiful thought to see that paintings are a showing of a moment because moments are always fleeting. It is much different than a photograph thought, as paintings are curated to fit the mood more than to fit the accuracy. It was also interesting to watch the differences between traditional versus exceptional painting, and the price differences. </p>

    <p style="background-color:palegreen; font: size 20px; color:black;">This episode really showed me how curated marketing is. It showed how the main idea is to evoke emotion, an imagination, and a false reality to make the consumer want this fake ideal life that is provided in the picture. At the end of the day, the publicity mentioned are “dreams with an invitation to join,” and that is thought-provoking since I see advertisements everyday. Although I always knew they were mained to make me desire an object, in reality they just want you to have a product. The most interesting portion of the video was when he says that in reality, the objects portrayed are just mere objects, very neutral, but the images are what makes the consumer feel the need to have them. This idea of if you have this object then life will be better is slightly terrifying because it is so real. This is commonly seen today where everyone wants the newest advancements of everything, since the way it has been marketed makes it seem like the object is a necessity in making life better. However, a good table stays good for a 100 years; yet, it seems “old” to the people who obtain it. Out of the 4 episodes, this is the one I enjoyed the most because it was relatable to society today, even though it was made in 1972. I believe it’s actually an issue that has been getting worse. It is important to remember that advertisements are curated for the consumer to want it, not just to show what it is. It is sad that people would be willing to spend their last penny to obtain an item that seems valuable, when it is just an item. There is nothing that special to them.</p>
