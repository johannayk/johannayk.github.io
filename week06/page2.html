            <h1>HIP HOP NEEDS A SOCIAL SPACE</h1>
            <p>Having a social space is important to African-American identity as it helps provide spatial practices for the community where they can create art without it being seen as “vandalism” and degradation. Having a spot for graffiti work, vendor booths, and hip hop dances is part of the Hip Hop Park project. This ties into Craig L. Wilkins when he describes how Lefebvre and de Certeau see space as “performed communication,” where people can interact and showcase who they are without feeling as if it will be ridiculed. This desire for “home place” should be added as it is vital in communal aspects. Hip Hop is a performative art, and the space to perform is essential for it to thrive. </p>
