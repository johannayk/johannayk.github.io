        The article “As We May Think” written by Vannevar Bush was really thought-invoking in the sense that it showed how everything regarding information is connected to one 
        another, but also that there are many flaws. Well, not necessarily flaws but there are ways to advance all the technology out there, but it does not occur as often. It 
        was impressive to read about and see how there are so many differences and different components to everything we use, especially within the photography world. However, 
        my most interest was when it came to the systems of a store and how delicate the system really is. It makes sense since technology is truly a way that mass information 
        and data could be analyzed into ways that humans may understand; however, there are clearly improvements that could be made. Science is important within the technological 
        world because it is essentially the catalyst for all this to work. I did not realize that, making this a really new discovery. This article was truly detailed and eye-opening 
        in teaching me that not all technology out there is perfect, but shows me that there are people who do resist the improvements, even though it would be not only faster, but beneficial.

      <p4 style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right:10%">
        The reading “Long Live the Web” is very true to the times today as the web is so broad and constantly changing, filled with a multitude of information that is consumed every single day for the majority of Americans. This article highlighted how the web may be in danger of straying away from its principles of “free speech.” This causes concern for an everyday user, such as I, because the amount of data I see on the lack of privacy within the web is truly concerning. It is also eye-opening to see that when you use certain URLs from companies, you are redirected to centralized areas that are technically not the web anymore. It really showed me how much control people can have over you  on the internet, and it definitely is of concern because the internet is important in respecting us as humans, not just cogs in a capitalist society.
