           <p> “all the world’s a stage, and we are merely actors,”</p>
           <p>"Hip hop architecture is concerned primarily with identity, and
            central to the creation of that identity are patterns of performance that are created by the music, by the musicians, and by the listeners."</p>
            <p>"Hip hop architecture is engaged in taking existing architecture
                and transforming it into something that expresses the spatial practices of the residents of marginalized communities, an object that
                makes sense to them."</p>
            <p>“Music is nothing but organized noise. You can take anything—street sounds, us talking, whatever you want—and make it
                music by organizing it.”</p>
            <p>"7 At its most basic level,
                music is for the diaspora an unconscious way of being that informs
                both the physical and mental response to its call and is acted out in
                all variety of ways, subtle and not. At its most heightened, it is a
                recognition and celebration of an Africentric life force."</p>
